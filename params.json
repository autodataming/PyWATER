Gruening\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nScipy and Numpy python modules installed on Python 2.7 are required to run PyWATER.\r\nPyWATER should be installed as a PyMOL plugin.\r\n\r\n- Run PyMOL\r\n- Install the pyWATER plugin in PyMOL by selecting PyWATER.py in the PyMOL Plugin Manager (Plugins → Manage Plugins → Install)\r\n- Restart PyMOL to use plugin\r\n\r\n - If you start PyMOL with administrator priviliges, PyWATER results and log files will be only accessible by the administrator.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Enabling Plugins in MacPyMOL**   \r\nIn order to install plug-ins from inside MacPyMOL, you have to rename the \"MacPyMOL.app\" to \"PyMOLX11Hybrid.app\" in your Applications folder, which will start PyMOL in the X Window System (X11) mode (requires an installation of [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUser Interface\r\n==============\r\n\r\nAfter installation as plugin, PyWATER can be run from PyMOL's Graphical User Interface, via the commandline or PyMOL’s python API.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nStart PyMOL\r\nOpen PyWATER plugin fromPyMWOLTcl-Tk GUI: Plugin PyWATER\r\nFigure 1 shows the snapshot of PyWATER as PyMOL plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

The most impartant informations are included in your PyMOL session for visual inspection.\r\nA detailed log file, summary files and optionally intermediate files will be stored under your $HOME directory in a folder called ``PyWATER_outdir``.\r\nFor every run a subfolder with the naming schema ``PDBid_CHAINid`` will be created and we recommend to go once through all files to get a feeling of all stored informations.\r\nThe following list will describe all different result files created by PyWATER:\r\n\r\n    - The query protein structure is saved with all indentified conserved water molecules in PDB file format\r\n    - A PyMOL session is given with predifend coloring and highlighting the important water molecules\r\n    \r\n        - conserved water molecules, with H-bonds in between them or with protein and/or the ligand are displayed\r\n        - all conserved water molecules are colored according to their degree of conservation\r\n\r\n    - A log file ``pywater.log`` with all input parameters, program messages, warning and errors\r\n    - The degree of conservation of each cluster is given in a tabular file with all atom numbers of water molecules from each superimposed pdb structure\r\n\r\nWe tried hard to output as many information as possible to enable further post-processing steps. For example, user can analyze the surroundings of a water molecule which is conserved in most proteins but not present in some. Rotameric conformations of side chains of nearby residues may result in displacement of water molecule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n=======\r\n\r\n- v1.0: Initial public release\r\n\r\n\r\nLicence (MIT)\r\n=============\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
